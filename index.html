					<strong>New for 2022:</strong> I am currently a research scientist in Google's <a href="https://pair.withgoogle.com">People + AI Research Group</a>. I'm starting some new and exciting projects at Google, which I will eventually post about here.
				</p>
				<p>I am not currently accepting new students.</p>
				<p>My research leverages HCI, AI, and machine learning to support equality, independence, health, and creativity for people with disabilities. My <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=v564lDgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Google Scholar</a> page contains a list of recent publications.</p>
				<p>Previously I founded the <a href="http://superhuman.cs.colorado.edu">Superhuman Computing Lab</a> at <a href="http://cs.colorado.edu">CU Boulder</a>, and I still work with many great colleagues and students there.
