				<h3 style="margin-top: 0px;">Schedule a meeting with me</h3>
				<p>If you are interested in meeting with me, here are a few options for doing so:</p>
				<h3>BOLD Center</h3>
				<p>In Fall 2018 and Spring 2019, I'm a faculty fellow at CU's <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/bold/">BOLD Center,</a> where I am working to address challenges to maintaining a diverse engineering community.</p>
				<p>As part of this project, I am keeping weekly BOLD community hours. These are for students who are already involved with the BOLD center, or for anyone else, to discuss issues about the campus culture, computer science classes, computing as a career, universal design of technology, and other topics.</p>
				<p>My current office hours are <strong>Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 3 pm</strong>, at BOLD (in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/map/?id=336&mrkIid=193854">Engineering Center</a>). You can make an appointment with me at the following link:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://calendly.com/shaunkane/office-hours/">Schedule a meeting with Shaun at BOLD</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>During these hours you can also drop in, although if you don't see any appointment slots for that day, it might mean that I am out of office.</p>	
	<h3>Class and other topics</h3>	
	<p>If you would like to meet to discuss a class, a potential research project, or related topics, the best option would be to schedule a meeting during my office hours. My current office hours are <strong>Friday from 2 to 2:30 pm</strong> in <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/campusmap/map.html?bldg=DLC">DLC 173</a>. You can make an appointment with me at the following link:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://calendly.com/shaunkane/office-hours/">Schedule a meeting with Shaun in DLC</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>If these times don't work for whatever reason, or if you need to schedule another type of meeting, please <a href="mailto:shaun.kane@colorado.edu">email me</a>.</p>
